# Liri-Node-App

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Getting Started

1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.
3. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests using the axios package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.

### Prerequisites

Installed the following dependencies in a JSON package:

1. Node-Spotify-API
2. Axios-You'll use Axios to grab data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API
3. Moment
4. DotEnv


## Running the tests

Used console.log to test code.
